# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler allows you to insert your daily tasks in the textareas and save them. The text areas color will change depending on the time for past, present and future.

During this assignment I learned how to use Jquery and moment(), I was able to practice using for loops, if/else statements and storing information in local storage and retreiving that infomation.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
I take credit for my Jquery code and some of the HTML. Part of the HTML code and all of the CSS were provided to us. I also received some help from my instructor Phil Loy.
